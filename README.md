# Dynamics-PLI

Official PyTorch-based implementation in the paper [Molecular dynamics-powered hierarchical geometric deep learning framework for protein-ligand interaction]([https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad404](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955744)). In this article, we develop a SO(3)-equivariant hierarchical graph neural network (EHGNN) that effectively captures the intrinsic hierarchy of biomolecular structures to enhance the predictive performance of PL interaction.
